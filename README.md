# Elvanto-Kidz-Visitor-Sign-In
A small HTML and CSS combination that pulls a form from Elvanto using JS, removes unnecessary elements and styles the document.
I created this as there was a need for a solution like this at my church, but it could be used in a variety of ways.
It is heavily optimised for mobile and tablet use, but can be easily adjusted within the included stylesheet.

*REQUIRES A JS-CAPABLE BROWSER*

SETUP:
1. Download "index.html" and "styles.css" into one central location.
2. Set up a form within Elvanto, copy the Javascript embed link, and replace the current embed link in index.html with the new one.
   1. If you wish to utilise a loop (Form -> Thanks -> Form), download the "thankyou.html" file.
   2. Edit the button target within "thankyou.html" to point to the the future location of "index.html".
   3. Decide where you wish to keep the files and change the form success target to point to the future location of "index.html".
3. Upload or place the files in the location you have chosen.
